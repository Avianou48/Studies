         For Joins problems Use this tutorial if needed :

⦁	Join the film to the film_actor table. 

  

SELECT * FROM film_actor; 

SELECT * FROM film 

  

SELECT * FROM film_actor 

INNER JOIN film 

ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id  

ORDER BY film.film_id; 

  

  

⦁	Join the actor table to the film_actor table.  

SELECT * FROM film_actor; 

SELECT * FROM actor 

  

SELECT * FROM actor 

INNER JOIN film_actor 

ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id  

ORDER BY film_actor.actor_id; 

  

  

⦁	Try to join the actor, film_actor, and film table together (3 joins!) 

SELECT * FROM film_actor; 

SELECT * FROM actor 

SELECT * FROM film 

  

SELECT * FROM actor 

JOIN film_actor 

ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id  

JOIN film  

ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id ;

And attached data set (Student_data and Student_marks ) answer the following questions : 

-- students with the highest marks in Unit 4 

	SELECT * FROM student 

SELECT * FROM student_marks 

  

--  Get the highest mark in unit4 that is equal to 100-- 

SELECT MAX(unit4) FROM student_marks 

  

SELECT * FROM student_marks 

WHERE student_marks.unit4 = 100 

  

--Count number of student with highest mark, there are 43 -- 

SELECT COUNT (*) FROM student_marks 

WHERE student_marks.unit4 = 100 

  

  

  

	-- Find students scored between 89 and 100 unit4  

	SELECT * FROM student_marks 

WHERE unit4 BETWEEN 89 and 100 

  

  

  

  

	 

	Open ended questions: 

	-- Take a closer look at the tables that you created and come up with 10 different scenarios/ questions and form SQL
